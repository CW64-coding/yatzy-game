# Yatzy Game
## Introduction
This repository contains code I have written purely for practice of Python, Vim and Git/GitHub usage.

The code runs a text-based user-input style game of Maxi Yatzy, as a fun way to explore several programming concepts.

When the code is run, a text input-based game for 2-6 players is initiated.

All code is purely my own, developed from scratch through trial-and-error and basic online research.


### Game background: Maxi Yatzy (aka "Swedish Yatzhee")
Maxi Yatzy is Yahtzee with an extra die, more ways to score points and a feature where you can save extra rolls for later.

Assuming the reader is familiar with Yatzhee/Yatzy, below are the variations compared to 'regular' Yatzhee:-
* 6 dice instead of 5, and hence several extra scoring combinations on the scoreboard
* players can choose to forfeit one or two of the maximum 3 possible rolls in a turn and instead save up re-rolls that can be used in later turns
* players can choose to score a combination at any time (within the current section - 'Upper' or 'Lower'), rolls do not follow the order of the scoreboard
* bonus points are scored if a player achieves a minimum subtotal of 75+ points in the Upper section.
